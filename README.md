# Contao legacy templates (HTML5)

Restores the HTML elements in Contao 5

## Purpose of this Plugin

This plugin only serves the purpose to make sure that individuals that migrated from Contao 4.13 to 5.x have time to
adjust their templates to Twig.

> **HTML5 support will be removed in Contao 6**

If you encounter issues with Twig-Templates such as errors, uninstall this plugin as you won't need it anymore :)
